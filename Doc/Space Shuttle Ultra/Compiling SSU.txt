This document describes how to setup the libraries required to compile SSU.

OrbiterSound: Copy the OrbiterSDK35 .lib and .h files (in Sound/OrbiterSound_SDK/VESSELSOUND_SDK) into the orbitersdk/lib and orbitersdk/include folders, respectively.


If you don't want to run the unit tests, you can simply unload the libUltraTests project in Visual Studio, and the tests will not be compiled.
GoogleTest is required to build and run the unit tests.
GoogleTest:
	Download the Google Test. Extract the zip into orbitersdk, and rename the folder to googletest.
	Open the googletest/msvc/gtest-md.sln file and compile both the Release and Debug versions.
	Copy the gtest.lib and gtest_main-md.lib files (from the Release build) and the gtestd.lib and gtest_main-mdd.lib (from the Debug build) into orbitersdk/googletes/lib/Dynamic.
