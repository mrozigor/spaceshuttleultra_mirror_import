LEE Switching:
	Each LEE has 2 attach points (to parent and to child).
	Switching process:
		Current base detaches from parent, but remains 'grappled'.
		Other LEE (already grappled) attaches to parent attach point.
Arm Position/direction data:
	The arm_ee_pos vector measures position relative to the SR joint of LEE1.
	The reference frame is defined below:
		X -> axis around which roll joints rotate
		Y -> axis around which pitch joints rotate
		Z -> axis around which yaw joints rotate
IK Ref Frame:
	X -> axis around which roll joints rotate
	Y -> axis around which pitch joints rotate
	Z -> axis around which yaw joints rotate
